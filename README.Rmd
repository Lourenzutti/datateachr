_Pronounced "Data Teacher"_

The goal of `datateachr` is to provide an easy way to access open source data for educational purposes. It contains several semi-tidied data sets obtained from multiple sources.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")
```

### Vignette 
You may also access this information through our vignette. First use this command for installation: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

And to read the vignette use: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(datateachr)
browseVignettes("datateachr")
```
